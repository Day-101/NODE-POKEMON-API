# NODE POKEMON API

This is a remade project from a tutorial by **Simon DIENY**.

The purpose is to be better with NodeJS.

You can get the name of a pokemon with an URL request :
Ex: http://localhost:3000/api/pokemons/1

You can get the total number of pokemons with the URL request :
http://localhost:3000/api/pokemons

Have a nice day !
